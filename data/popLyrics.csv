We'll be moving along, at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road. and then we'll cross at Abbot's Road, and we'll be covering some distance, twelve minutes to three we'll be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge. Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge we're in Westminster Borough area. It's quite possible we may encounter some Jew boys and from now on we've got to be careful by the way we go. At eighteen after midday, we'll all be at Hyde Park! and there we'll continue?..."",Hammer, hammer... ",False

"Into the distance a ribbon of black, Stretched to the point of no turning back, A flight of fancy on a wind swept field, Standing alone my senses reeled, A fatal attraction is holding me fast, How can I escape this irresistible grasp?,Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky, Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I,Ice is forming on the tips of my wings, Unheeded warnings I thought, I thought of everything, No navigator to find my way home, Unladened, empty and turned to stone,A soul in tension that's learning to fly, Condition grounded but determined to try, Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies, Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I,Above the planet on a wing and a prayer, My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air, Across the clouds I see my shadow fly, Out of the corner of my watering eye, A dream unthreatened by the morning light, Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night,There's no sensation to compare with this, Suspended animation, a state of bliss, Can't keep my mind from the circling sky, Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I ",False
"You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need, Got to sleep on your toes and when you're on the street, Got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed, Then moving in silently down wind and out of sight, You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking,And after a while you can work on points for style, Like the club tie and the firm handshake, A certain look in the eye and an easy smile, You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to, So that when they turn their backs on you, You'll get the chance to put the knife in,You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder, You know it's going to get harder, harder and harder as you get older, Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south, Hide your head in the sand, Just another sad old man, All alone and dying of cancer,And when you lose control you'll reap the harvest you have sown, And as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone, And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around, So have a good drown as you go down all alone, Dragged down by the stone,Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused, Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used, Gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise, If I don't stand my own ground how can I find my way out of this maze,Deaf, dumb and blind you just keep on pretending, That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend, And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner, And everything's done under the sun, And you believe at heart everyone's a killer,Who was born in a house full of pain, Who was trained not to spit in the fan, Who was told what to do by the man, Who was broken by trained personnel, Who was fitted with collar and chain, Who was given a pat on the back, Who was breaking away from the pack, Who was only a stranger at home, Who was ground down in the end, Who was found dead on the phone, Who was dragged down by the stone, Who was dragged down by the stone ",False
